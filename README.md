This Repo is a fork of [@RealKoolisw]'s [RBX-BackendAPI](https://github.com/RealKoolisw/RBX-BackendAPI)

# RBX-BackendAPI

Backend Process API Server of ROBLOX game including verification, auto rank processor, etc.

# ESM Runtime Reminder

This project uses ES Module system instead of "require" commonjs for faster and stable performace.
You can convert this back into commonJS module whatever you want.

# Extra

This project uses MongoDB as the database service, we provided extra ROBLOX player blacklist system when players are verifying or joining the game.
More cool and new features coming soon.
